# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Blinkit, focusing on understanding total sales, average sales per item, outlet performance, and item type contributions. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales performance across different outlet sizes, locations, and product categories.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
Power BI: Data transformation and visualization

Data Cleaning (Excel)
Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
Handled missing values by either imputing relevant values or removing incomplete records.
Standardized item names and categories for consistency across analysis.
Converted data types (e.g., dates and currency formats) to ensure compatibility with Power BI.



Data Transformation & Visualization (Power BI)
Applied data transformations (e.g., filtering, grouping) to categorize items by outlet type, item type, and outlet size.
Created calculated columns and measures to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Total Sales: $1.20M
Average Sales per Item: $141
Number of Items: 8523
Average Rating: 3.9
Visualized data using bar charts, line graphs, and cards to highlight:
Sales by outlet type, outlet size, and location.
Contribution of different item categories (e.g., fruits, snacks, household items).
Fat content comparison between low-fat and regular products.
Time series analysis to track sales trends over multiple years (2012-2022).
